# Get_infoBot
This is an example of multiturn convesation with a bot. In this case, you can get some data from the user to do a book fligh. This is not the main of this post. There are multiples samples for bots deployed with Visual Studio (https://github.com/lpnieto/BotBuilder-Samples
). This post is focusing in the way to test one sample locally. It is easy but I found some errors at my first times. 
You can find in "Test your bot locally.pdf" how to test your bot locally. Also, frequently errors that I found while I try it at first times. You should follow these steps to test whatever bot built with Visual Studio locally.
