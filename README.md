# Test your bot locally
This is an example of multiturn convesation with a bot. In this case, you can get some data from the user to do a book flight. This is not the main of this post. There are multiples samples for bots deployed with Visual Studio (https://github.com/lpnieto/BotBuilder-Samples
). This post is focusing in the way to test one sample locally. It is easy but I found some errors at my first times. 
You can find in "Test your bot locally.pdf" how to test your bot locally. Also, frequently errors that I found while I try it at first times. You should follow these steps to test whatever bot built with Visual Studio locally. 


# Deploy your bot in Azure
Once you has running your bot locally, follow steps to deploy your bot to Teams with Azure. These steps are described in "Deploy your bot to Teams.pdf" file.
